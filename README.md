# ENPM809T - Autonomous Robotics

## Introduction

The **ENPM809T-Autonomous Robotics** course at the University of Maryland, College Park offers an enriching, hands-on experience in building a robot while exploring essential concepts in robotics, including **Perception**, **Planning**, **Controls**, and **Modeling**. Our ultimate goal is to achieve autonomy by applying these principles to a real robot.

Throughout the course, we have focused on critical areas such as **Perception**, **Sensor Integration and Calibration**, **Control**, **Localization**, and **Planning**. Each of these components plays a vital role in enhancing the capabilities of our autonomous robot. A significant highlight of this course is an exciting final challenge centered around a construction zone scenario, where our robot autonomously picks up objects and accurately places them between a designated start and goal point, simulating real-world applications in construction.

## Integration Details

The key hardware components of the robot include:

1. **Raspberry Pi** and **Pi Camera**
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor**
3. **Magnetic Encoders**
4. **H-Bridge**
5. **IMU** and **Arduino Nano**
6. **Gripper**
7. **DC Geared Motors** and wheels
8. **Chassis (Pirate)** to hold the entire robot assembly

The autonomous mobile robot operates independently, executing tasks by integrating fundamental robotics principles. In the final competition, the robot successfully picked up 8 out of 9 RGB blocks. The following process flow diagram illustrates how the robot accomplishes pick-and-place tasks through the seamless integration of both software and hardware components:
